This package was created for my needs during my various projects, wanting to go faster and faster and not being a fan of CMS, I decided to make myself a back office (an administration) according to my needs and applying my own conventions for not reinventing the wheel. I am aware that my organization and conventions may not be suitable for everyone.
You must use a **versioning** system like **git** in order to be able to **rollback** as needed because the package modifies and adds certain files.
All files are generated in your working folder and can be changed at your convenience. The package just serves for
file generator.

You need to publish the service provider first  and create guard.

```php
/**
 * Administration routes prefix.
 */
'auth_prefix_path' => 'administrable',
```

## Create guard

You need to create a guard entry in database before log in.

Example:

```php
php artisan administrable:create --username=johndoe --email=john@doe.fr --password=12345678
```

or with the short version

```php
php artisan administrable:create -u johndoe -e john@doe.fr -p 12345678
```
