This package was created for my needs during my various projects, wanting to go faster and faster and not being a fan of CMS, I decided to make myself a back office (an administration) according to my needs and applying my own conventions for not reinventing the wheel. I am aware that my organization and conventions may not be suitable for everyone.
You must use a **versioning** system like **git** in order to be able to **rollback** as needed because the package modifies and adds certain files.
All files are generated in your working folder and can be changed at your convenience. The package just serves for
file generator.

php artisan cmd:db:create

You can now log in to the back office with ***administrable*** route

 */
'auth_prefix_path' => 'administrable',
```

## Publish config and assets (css and js) files

Necessary for the theme.

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Guysolamour\Administrable\ServiceProvider"
```

## Empty  cache

```php
php artisan route:clear && php artisan config:clear
```

##  Create storage symbolic link

```php
php artisan storage:link
```

## Create guard

You need to create a guard entry in database before log in.

Example:

```php
php artisan administrable:create --username=johndoe --email=john@doe.fr --password=12345678
```

or with the short version

```php
php artisan administrable:create -u johndoe -e john@doe.fr -p 12345678
```

**NB:**

- you will be prompt if a option is not passed.
- available options are: *username*, *email* and *password*

## Seed database

You can seed the database with fake data

```php
php artisan db:seed --class ConfigurationsTableSeeder
```

If the **Post** crud was generated

```php
php artisan db:seed --class PostsTableSeeder
```

If the **Testimonial** crud was generated

```php
php artisan db:seed --class TestimonialsTableSeeder
```

If the **Mailbox** crud was generated

```php
php artisan db:seed --class MailboxesTableSeeder

```

The guard

```php
php artisan db:seed --class {guard}sTableSeeder
```

If the guard is admin:

```php
php artisan db:seed --class AdminsTableSeeder
```
