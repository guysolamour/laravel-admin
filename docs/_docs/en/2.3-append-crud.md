Append one or many fields on an existing model. The ***--field*** option is optional, in case it is not provided you will have to choose them interactively if new fields have been defined in the configuration file.

```bash
php artisan administrable:append:crud {model} --fields="field1,field2,field3" # or -f="field1,field2,field3"
```

The fields must be defined in the same way as that of the **administrable:make:crud** command in the  *administrable.yaml* file
