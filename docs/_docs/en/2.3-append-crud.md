To append one or many fields on an existing model.

```bash
php artisan administrable:append:crud {model} --fields="field1,field2,field3" # or -f="field1,field2,field3"
```

**NB:**
- The model must exists
- The fields must be defined in the same way as that of the **administrable:make:crud** command in the  *administrable.yaml* file
