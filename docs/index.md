{{ site.title }} is a package designed for the famous Laravel framework and which allows you to generate an administration panel with several themes to choose from. In addition, this package structures your code by separating the front and back files with a subfolder in each large folder (controllers, notifications, forms ...) and views. Finally, it comes with a ready-to-use blogging system, contact messages and user testimonials.
