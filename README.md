## Preamble

This package was created for my needs during my various projects, wanting to go faster and faster and not being a fan of CMS, I decided to make myself a back office (an administration) according to my needs and applying
my own conventions for not reinventing the wheel.
You must use a **versioning** system like **git** in order to be able to **rollback** as needed because the package modifies and adds certain files.
All files are generated in your working folder and can be changed at your convenience. The package just serves for
file generator.
